# Binary Search

The binary search algorithm is used to find a target element in a **sorted** array by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.

**Time Complexity:** $$O(\log n)$$

**Space Complexity:** $$O(1)$$

## Template

- **Initialization**: Set `left` to 0 and `right` to the last index of the array.
- **Loop Condition**: While `left` is less than or equal to `right`:
  - Calculate `mid` as the index of the middle element.
  - **Condition**:
    - If the middle element equals the target, return the index `mid`.
    - If the middle element is less than the target, update `left` to `mid + 1` (search in the right half).
    - If the middle element is greater than the target, update `right` to `mid - 1` (search in the left half).
- **Return**: If the target is not found, return -1.

## Example: Find Target Element in a **Rotated** Sorted Array

[LeetCode 33](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

To make this a bit more interesting, let's say the sorted array is **rotated**. Return the index of the target element if found, otherwise return -1.

- `arr` is a sorted ascending array (distinct values). It has been rotated at some unknown pivot `k` (`0 <= k < n`) such that the array is transformed into `arr[k], arr[k+1], ..., arr[n-1], arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[k-1]`.

This solution has a time complexity of $$O(\log n)$$ because we are using binary search.

**Case 1: Left half is sorted**
```
   |/     -- arr[mid]
  /|      -- (1.1) Target is in the left half
 / |
/  |      -- arr[left]
   |  /
   | /    -- (1.2) Target is in the right half
```

**Case 2: Right half is sorted**
```
   |
   |
 / |      -- (2.2) Target is in the left half
/  |      
   |  /   -- arr[right]
   | /    -- (2.1) Target is in the right half
   |/     -- arr[mid]
