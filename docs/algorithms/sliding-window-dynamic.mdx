# Sliding Window (Dynamic Size)

The sliding window algorithm is used to solve problems that involve finding the maximum or minimum sum of a subarray of a **dynamic** size. It is very similar to the [Two Pointers](/docs/algorithms/two-pointers) algorithm.

**Time Complexity:** $$O(n)$$

**Space Complexity:** $$O(1)$$

## Template

- `window` is some value computed from the current window
- `result` is the result of the problem which may be updated from the current window
- `condition` is the condition that determines whether the window should be shrunk from the left

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">
    ```python
    def sliding_window(arr: list) -> int:
        left = 0
        window = None
        result = None

        for right in range(len(arr)):
            # Process window (add right element)
            window = ...

            while condition:
                # Process window (remove left element)
                window = ...

                left += 1

            # Update result
            result = ...

        return result
    ```
  </TabItem>

## Example: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Here's an example of finding the longest substring without repeating characters using the sliding window technique.

- `window` (dictionary) is the count of characters in the current window
- `result` (string) is the longest substring without repeating characters
- `condition` shrinks the window from the left if the current window now contains a repeating character due to the addition of a new character from the right

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">
    ```python
    def longest_substring_without_repeating_characters(s: str) -> str:
        left = 0
        window = {}  # Count of characters in the current window
        result = ""  # Longest substring without repeating characters

        for right in range(len(s)):
            # Process window (add right character)
            window[s[right]] = window.get(s[right], 0) + 1

            while window[s[right]] > 1:
                # Process window (remove left character)
                window[s[left]] -= 1
                left += 1

            # Update result
            if len(window) > len(result):
                result = s[left:right+1]

        return result
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You could also return the **length** of the longest substring by doing `result = right - left + 1` instead of `result = s[left:right+1]`.


## Example: Longest Substring With Up To K Unique Characters

Here's an example of finding the longest substring with up to `k` unique characters using the sliding window technique.

- `window` (dictionary) is the count of characters in the current window
- `result` (string) is the longest substring with up to `k` unique characters
- `k` (integer) represents the maximum number of unique characters allowed in the current window. For this specific case, `k` should be set to 1 to ensure no repeating characters.
- `condition` shrinks the window from the left if the current window now contains more than `k` unique characters

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">
    ```python
    def longest_substring_with_k_unique_characters(s: str, k: int = 1) -> int:  # Default k to 1
        left = 0
        window = {}  # Count of characters in the current window
        result = ""  # Longest substring with up to k unique characters

        for right in range(len(s)):
            # Process window (add right character)
            window[s[right]] = window.get(s[right], 0) + 1
            
            # Shrink window from the left if condition is met
            while len(window) > k:  # Here, k is the max number of unique characters allowed in the current window
                # Process window (remove left character)
                window[s[left]] -= 1
                if window[s[left]] == 0:
                    del window[s[left]]
                left += 1

            # Update result
            if len(window) > len(result):
                result = s[left:right+1]

        return result
    ```
