# Two Pointers

Two pointers algorithms efficiently solve problems involving sorted arrays, pairs, or sub-arrays/sub-strings by avoiding the $$O(n^2)$$ complexity of nested loops. The pointers can start from the same or opposite ends of the array, and this technique is useful for maintaining linear traversal. [Sliding Window (Fixed)](/docs/algorithms/sliding-window) and [Sliding Window (Dynamic)](/docs/algorithms/sliding-window-dynamic) are variants of two pointers.

**Time Complexity:** $$O(n)$$

**Space Complexity:** $$O(1)$$

## Examples

### Two Sum II ([L167](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/))

Given a 1-indexed **non-decreasing** array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Return the indices of the two numbers as an array of length 2. 

- `left` is the index of the first number
- `right` is the index of the second number
- `condition` is how `arr[left] + arr[right]` compares to `target`

  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">
    ```python
    def two_sum(arr, target):
        left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
        while left < right:
            two_sum = arr[left] + arr[right]
            if two_sum < target:
                left += 1
            elif two_sum > target:
                right -= 1
            else:
                return [left + 1, right + 1]
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array ([L26](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/))

Given a sorted in **non-decreasing array**, remove duplicates in-place by reordering such that the first `k` elements contain unique elements in the order they were present in the original array. Return `k`.

- `right` is the index being scanned ahead of `left`
- `left` is the index of the last unique element
- `result` is the number of unique elements in the array is `left + 1`
- `condition` is `arr[left] == arr[right]`

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">
    ```python
    def remove_duplicates(arr):
        left, right = 0, 1
        while right < len(arr):
            if arr[left] == arr[right]:
                right += 1
            else:
                left += 1
                arr[left] = arr[right]
                right += 1

        return left + 1
    ```

## When to Use Two Pointers

1. **Sorted Arrays**: 
   - If the input array is sorted (or can be sorted), two pointers can efficiently find pairs or ranges of elements that meet certain conditions (e.g., finding two numbers that sum to a target).
   - Example: In the "Two Sum II" problem, you can use two pointers starting from both ends of the sorted array.

2. **Finding Pairs**:
   - When the problem involves finding pairs of elements that satisfy a specific condition (e.g., sum, product), two pointers can help avoid the \(O(n^2)\) complexity of nested loops.
   - Example: In the "Container With Most Water" problem, two pointers can be used to maximize the area between two lines.

3. **Subarray Problems**:
   - For problems that require finding a subarray that meets certain criteria (e.g., maximum sum, longest unique substring), two pointers can help maintain a sliding window.
   - Example: In the "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" problem, you can use two pointers to track the start and end of the current substring.

4. **Merging or Partitioning**:
   - When merging two sorted arrays or partitioning an array based on a condition, two pointers can help traverse both arrays efficiently.
   - Example: Merging two sorted lists into one sorted list.

5. **Space Efficiency**:
   - If the problem requires in-place modifications or has constraints on space usage, two pointers can help achieve the desired result without additional data structures.

## When Not to Use Two Pointers

1. **Unsorted Arrays**:
   - If the array is unsorted and you need to find pairs or elements based on conditions that require knowledge of the entire array, two pointers may not be effective.

2. **Complex Conditions**:
   - If the condition for moving the pointers is complex and cannot be easily defined, a brute-force approach might be more straightforward.

3. **Non-linear Structures**:
   - For problems involving trees or graphs, other traversal methods (like depth-first or breadth-first search) may be more appropriate.
